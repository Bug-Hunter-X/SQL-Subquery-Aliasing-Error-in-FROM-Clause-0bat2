# SQL Subquery Aliasing Error

This repository demonstrates a common SQL error related to aliasing subqueries within the FROM clause. The issue stems from an incorrect or missing alias for the subquery, preventing the database from correctly interpreting and executing the query.

The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.

The error arises from the lack of a proper alias for the subquery.  Without a descriptive alias, the database struggles to differentiate the inner query's output from other tables or data structures in the main query. This leads to a variety of errors, depending on the database system and SQL dialect.
