The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause to retrieve data, but it fails due to a syntax error related to aliasing the subquery.  The error message varies depending on the specific SQL dialect, but generally points to an issue with the way the subquery is referenced.

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE country = 'USA') AS users_usa WHERE id > 10;
```
