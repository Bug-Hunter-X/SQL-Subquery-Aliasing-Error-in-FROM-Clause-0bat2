The solution involves correctly aliasing the subquery using the `AS` keyword, providing a clear name to refer to the subquery's results in the main query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE country = 'USA') AS users_usa WHERE id > 10;
```

This corrected version clearly identifies the subquery's results as `users_usa`, enabling the main query to access the data correctly.  It is crucial to ensure aliases are correctly used when working with subqueries in the FROM clause of SQL queries to avoid syntax errors.
